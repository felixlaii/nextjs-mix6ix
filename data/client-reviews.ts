      "My family and I were and continue to be incredibly impressed by MIX6IX’s professionalism, energy and knowledge. They always comes prepared and can adapt to any situation, including offering a variety of drink options to making sure all guests are served promptly. Prior to our event, they kept in correspondence and made sure everything was in place; asked about attire, drink preferences, cocktail options and made phenomenal suggestions in accordance to our event. Highly recommend!! By far one of the most knowledgeable and organized bartenders we have come across!",

      "MIX6IX was an incredible bartender for our engagement party! Very professional and just a very personable experience in general. We gave them the alcohol base we wanted to use for our drinks and they produced a menu for us. We were able to get everything ready to go with just one month of planning. Would definitely recommend!",

      "The MIX6IX team was phenomenal as always. Our company had an open house event with over 400 people shifting in and out of our office. The MIX6IX team kept our guests refreshed and engaged. They managed to put all this together with less than a weeks notice. ",

      "MIX6iX was an amazing bartender for our engagement party! MIX6IX worked with us a month before to come up with unique cocktails that fit our tastes and was very accommodating to our set up (we did a backyard engagement party so we didn't have any standard bar set up). They were extremely personable and chatted with our guests. Very professional and just a very personable experience in general. Would definitely recommend!",
